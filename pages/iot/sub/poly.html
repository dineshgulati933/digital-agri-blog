						<h2>low-cost recording-type microcontroller-based temperature, humidity, and light intensity sensor</h2>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">Monitoring the climate parameters and light intensity inside 
							the greenhouse is as important as observing these parameters outside the greenhouse to 
							maintain proper plant growth and good-quality agricultural products. Generally, these 
							parameters inside the greenhouse depend upon the greenhouse shape, the material used, its 
							size, and ventilation type along with the location and climate conditions. Advanced 
							technologies to monitor these parameters have already been implemented in the greenhouse 
							to ensure good plant yield. However, these instruments are quite expensive and not 
							affordable by small poly house owners. Advancements in information and communication 
							technologies and micro-mechanized sensors allowed the development of low-cost hardware for 
							automation and monitoring in agriculture. Low-cost sensors along with open-source platforms 
							for programming purposes have facilitated the monitoring and control of environmental and 
							crop-related variables in protected environment agriculture. Therefore, we have developed 
							and implemented a microcontroller-based sensor to measure inside and outside climate 
							parameters and light intensity for a naturally ventilated tunnel-type greenhouse.</p>

							<p><b>Arduino uno R3</b></p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">A microcontroller can be defined as a single-chip special-purpose
							 computer dedicated to performing one specific task in a loop. It consists of memory (RAM, 
							 ROM, and flash), input and output pins, and a processor core like a multitasking processor 
							 in a computer. However, this microcontroller core is not as fast as in general 
							 purpose-computer. In this project, we used the ATmega8535-based microcontroller 
							 manufactured by Arduino which is an 8-bit AVR CPU, 8KB flash, 512 Byte EEPROM with 
							 512 Bytes internal SRAM.</p>
						<p><b>Selection of sensor</b></p>
						<p><b>Temperature and humidity sensor</b></p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">Integrated temperature and relative humidity (RH) sensors DHT11 
							and DHT22 were selected for this research work and tested at various field conditions for 
							calibration and validation purposes. Both these sensors DHT11 and DHT22 have three pins for
							 voltage input, a ground pin, and a digital data pin. The temperature and RH range of DHT11 
							 is 0 to 50C and 20 to 80%, respectively while for DHT22 range varies from -40 to 125C and 0 
							 to 100%, respectively. The data sampling rate of DHT11 can be as low as one-second while in 
							 the case of DHT22 sampling rate is of two seconds.</p>
						<p><b>Light sensor</b></p>	
						<p style="text-align: justify;">To monitor the light intensity inside and outside of the 
							greenhouse two light sensors, Adafruit BH1750 and TSL2591 were selected for evaluation 
							purposes. These sensors were tested at various light intensities and compared with ideal 
							available commercial light sensors for performance evaluation. Both sensors work on the I2C 
							interface and can measure light in terms of lux. The range of the former is 0 to 65,000 lx 
							while the latter can measure light from 0 to 88,000 lx.</p>
						<p><b>Real-time clock and SD card holder</b></p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">The integrated data logger shield from Adafruit consists of an 
							inbuilt DS1307 real-time clock (RTC) and SD card slot work on FAT16 or FAT32 to store 
							monitored data used during the experiment. This shield comes with a button-type battery to 
							power RTC in case the shield power is cut-off so that time recording will continue. This 
							shield communicates with Arduino either through an inter-integrated circuit (I2C) or serial 
							peripheral interface (SPI).</p>
						<p><b>Liquid crystal display (LCD)</b></p>	
						<p style="text-align: justify;">A 16x2 LCD display with an I2C interface was employed to display
							 real-time values of various parameters after a specific time interval along with storing 
							 data inside the memory card.</p>
						<p><b>Working</b></p>
						<p style="text-align: justify;">The programming of the microcontroller was accomplished on 
							Arduino integrated development environment (IDE). In this program, instead of the delay 
							function to control time interval, the millis function is adopted which has a number of 
							advantages over the former function. With the help of the latter, virtually we are running 
							two programs simultaneously as different time intervals were selected for displaying 
							parameters on display and storing them in the SD card. As shown in the flow chart, after 
							a particular time, digital signals are sent from the temperature and humidity sensor, and 
							12C communication from the light sensor to send light luminosity along with a time stamp 
							from RTC, and the data is display on LCD or stored in memory card based on time interval. 
							TCA9548A, which is an I2C multiplexer that allows you to connect multiple I2C devices to a 
							single I2C bus, is used to connect multiple light sensors (TSL2591) as they both have the 
							same I2C address. It acts as a switch and allows one sensor to use the I2C bus at a 
							particular time so as to receive unambiguous data.</p>
